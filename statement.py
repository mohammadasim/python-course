# Control flow syntax makes use of colons and indentation (whitespace)
# This indentation system is crucial to python and is what sets it apart from other programming languages.
# If a condition is true we execute a piece of code, we then put else, followed by code if the condition is false this piece
# of code will be executed. However if we want to check for multiple conditions before the else part can be executed
# For this we follow the if part with an elif statement that also has a conditional check.
