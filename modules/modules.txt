# PyPI is a repository for open-source third party python packages.
# Modules are just .py scripts that you call in another .py script.
# Packages are a collection of modules
# __init__.py has to be in the same folder to let python know that it should treat this as a package.
# In this folder we created two files mymodule.py and myprogram.py and we imported a function from one of it into another.

Package:
We have created two folders, MyMainPackage and SubPackage. In order for python to understand that these folders are packages we have to create
__init__.py files in both these folders.

Using this folder structure we were able to use functions in other packages in our myprogram.py file
