'''
In python 0 is treated as false and other numbers are treated as true.
Let's check in the following example.
'''

zero = 0
one = 1
two = 2

if zero:
    print('You were wrong, zero is not treated as true')
else:
    print('You were right, zero is treated a false')

if one:
    print('1 is treated as true')

if two:
    print('2 is treated as true')
